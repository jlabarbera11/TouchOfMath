The Vision: Empowering Humanity with Multi-Touch Mathematics

Newton, Euler, Gauss, Dirilecht, Riemann, Ramanujan, none of
these gentlemen will ever be my peer. They simply won't consider
asking me if I'd like to store my brain in a jar for the children
 of the future. 

 However, I have a computer. With a multitouch interface.

 And I too can be good at math!
