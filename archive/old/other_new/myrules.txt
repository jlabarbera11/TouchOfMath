place ancestor of target on other side, invert target if ancestor invertible and !unary

if mtarget !invertible or unary, splinter and ancestor becomes target. then back to step 1

if parent of target is root, call splinter if !unary or !invertible 

otherwise, copy target on other side and leave children (if parent of target is root)
